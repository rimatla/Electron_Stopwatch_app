 - Electron is an open-source framework. It allows the development of desktop GUI applications using the Node.js runtime and the Chromium web browser.

 - package.json
  We'll be using Electron, React and Webpack.
  Webpack
  a)"watch", runs Webpack in, obviously, watch mode to re-compile on change our bundle.
  b)"build", builds the application
  c)"app", starts Electron and displays the application.

  # build the application with webpack for the first time
  $ npm run build
  # display the application with Electron
  $ npm run app
